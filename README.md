# Silent-Speech-Recognition-
This repository contains the implementation for the paper Silent Speech Recognition: Advancing Lip Reading with Bi-Directional LSTM on the GRID Dataset. The work focuses on leveraging Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to improve the accuracy of silent speech recognition through effective lip-reading techniques.
